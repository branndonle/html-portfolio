<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Brandon Le, a proud alumnus of Georgia Tech,
  where I earned my B.S. in Computer Science in December 2023
  with a focus on Intelligence and Media. 
  My academic journey honed my expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  Despite my proficiency in these cutting-edge fields, my career aspirations have led me to pivot toward a new direction: web development. 
  I'm passionate about leveraging my technical background and skill set to delve into the realm of creating innovative and user-centric web experiences. 
  My goal is to combine my knowledge of machine learning and AI with the dynamic world of web development to craft intuitive and impactful digital solutions.

<p>Growing up in the early 2000s, technology wasn't as pervasive as it is today, but my fascination with it began early. As an adolescent, I was introduced to the world of computing through my own computer, initially for gaming. Yet, beyond playing games, I found myself captivated by the intricate coding behind these digital worlds and the artistry that made them visually stunning.
  This curiosity led me to delve deeper into the mechanics of computers and programming. It was during high school, when I enrolled in an AP Computer Science class, that my passion for coding solidified. The more I learned, the clearer it became: I wanted to pursue a career in computer science.
  My educational journey took me to Georgia State University for three enriching years before I made the pivotal transition to the Georgia Institute of Technology to complete my undergraduate studies. This shift allowed me to immerse myself fully in a vibrant academic environment tailored to my passion for technology and coding.
  Each step in this journey has reinforced my fervor for computer science and has propelled me toward my goal of leveraging technology to innovate and create impactful solutions

  My journey through several courses at Georgia Tech ignited a profound interest
  in web development. These courses served as a canvas for me to not only explore but also amplify my creativity and problem-solving abilities. Witnessing the soaring demand for these skills further fueled my enthusiasm.
  I am inherently drawn to continuous learning, finding immense gratification in honing my abilities to work efficiently and effectively. Web development, with its ever-evolving landscape, perfectly aligns with my passion for perpetual growth and abundant opportunities to expand my knowledge.
  Delving deeper into the realm of web development, I've discovered a realm where my creativity and technical skills harmoniously converge to craft practical and aesthetically pleasing solutions. Despite being relatively new to this domain, I'm fueled by a robust confidence in my abilities and an unwavering commitment to expanding my expertise.
  My ultimate aspiration is to leverage my skills and proficiency to create products that not only meet but exceed the expectations of users. I strive to bring joy and utility to individuals through the products I develop, consistently pushing the boundaries of my abilities to delight and serve others.
